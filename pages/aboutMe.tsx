Well, I have not learnt anything yet since I am new in this university. I am 17 years old and will be 18 this year. I live in Central Java and was born in Central Java too. Actually I wanna fill this using Lorem ipsum but I have more free time, lmao. For now I want to learn more about front-end things. Then, move to back-end and data science as I dunno about my passion. Just that. Probably I will need more time than I think.</p>
